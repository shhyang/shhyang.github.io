BATS can provide multi-hop wireless network connections for smart lampposts without laying optical fiber to every lamppost. Laying new optical fiber, even if feasible, will require much construction work and severely disturb traffic and pedestrians. On the other hand, BATS enjoys the advantages of a low operating cost and a higher level of network security and stability. It provides a city-friendly and economical solution for mass deployment of smart lampposts, and so it expedites the advent of smart cities and and improves peopleâ€™s quality of life.

Gold Medal (Gold Medal with Congratulations of the Jury).

Team members: Prof. YANG Shenghao (CUHK(SZ)), Prof. YEUNG Wai Ho Raymond (CUHK) and Dr. CHAN Kwong Wing Raymond (CUHK)
