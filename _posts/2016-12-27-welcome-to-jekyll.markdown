I modify the [jekyll-minima][jekyll-minima] theme and refer to the homepage of [Pascal Poizat][pascal-poizat].

One should read [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] before customizing.

The dropdown button from the minima theme does not work in Safari and Google Chrome on iPhone, but works fine in Firefox. I did not figure out a solution using CSS, so I modify the button using Javascript according to [this HowTo](http://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_topnav.asp).
