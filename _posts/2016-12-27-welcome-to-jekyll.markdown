I modify the [jekyll-minima][jekyll-minima] theme and refer to the homepage of [Pascal Poizat][pascal-poizat].

One should read [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] before customizing.

[jekyll-docs]: http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home
[jekyll-minima]: https://github.com/jekyll/minima
[pascal-poizat]: https://pages.lip6.fr/Pascal.Poizat/index.html
