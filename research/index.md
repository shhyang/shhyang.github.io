## Overview
My recent research interests include:
* **Network coding**, where we focus on the designs and implementations of wireless network communications for Internet of Things.
<!-- See more details in the [BATS code page][bats_page]. -->
* **Distributed storage and computation**, which can be regarded as generalized network coding problems and have applications in Big Data processing.
* **Machine learning**, where we are interested in the role of information learning.
* **Quantum information**, where we are interested in randomness problems related to Bell's tests.
